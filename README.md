Objectives and pre-requisites
=============================

This document describesÂ the steps necessary to deploy and manage Red Hat
OpenShift container platform, and CloudForms on Azure. The lab is based
on OpenShift version 3.5 and CloudForms version 4.1.

You will need an active Red Hat subscription and a valid Azure account
to perform the lab instructions.

-   Create your [free azure
    account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
    (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), today.

-   Request a free 30 days
    [evaluation](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-container-platform/evaluation)
    from RedHat
    (<https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-container-platform/evaluation>),
    (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/411973)

-   You need to have an account on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/), If
    you don't have one create a free account (<https://github.com/>).

[NB]{.underline}: As an alternative to OpenShift enterprise, you can
deploy the community version OpenShift.org. And as an alternative to
CloudForms, you can deploy the community version ManageIQ. The community
edition represents a test bed incubator and upstream to the enterprise
one. All OpenShift container platform features are also available in
OpenShift.org.

To perform the lab using OpenShift.org, follow the steps at
[https://github.com/Microsoft/openshift-origin](https://github.com/Microsoft/openshift-origina)
and skip Challenge-1.

[NB]{.underline}: If you want to use your corporate Azure account,
request a resource group with owner access control from your Azure
admin.

[NB:]{.underline} Even though, you can bring your own Red Hat
subscription for OpenShift, the deployment template in this lab will
provision the master and compute nodes from RHEL images, pay as you go.
You will incur extra charges not covered by the Azure free tier. Amount
varies depending on the number and size of the vm nodes.

The Lab challenges cover:

-   Introduction to OpenShift3

-   Deployment of OpenShit on Azure

-   Creating and managing OpenShift projects on azure

-   Creating and managing OpenShift applications on Azure

-   Automating builds with Linux Containers on Azure.

-   Mini project: Jboss EAP application

-   Integration of OpenShift with Azure OMS

-   Installation and introduction to CloudForms

Introduction to openshift
=========================

[OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com) containers platform is Red Hat\'s
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) on top of Kubernetes. It allows developers
to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment.

Microsoft and Red Hat have signed a partnership that includes support to
run Red Hat OpenShift on Microsoft Azure and Azure Stack.

OpenShift offers multiple access modes including: developer CLI, admin
CLI, web console and IDE plugins. Click2cloud is a plugin that allows
Visual studio to deploy code to OpenShift, directly.

CHALLENGE-1: Deploy Openshift on azure 
=======================================

OpenShift, leverages multiple Azure services such as VM *extensions*,
Azure disks, and *Key vaults...* to provide an Enterprise grade offering
for customers who would like to containerize and manage their
applications, without investing long time and hard effort configuring
and integrating various tools.

OpenShift offers another alternative to multiple CaaS (container as a
service) solutions available on Azure, such as *Azure container service,
Azure service fabric* and *Pivotal* from *CloudFoundry*...

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image4.png){width="4.99375in"
> height="1.9194444444444445in"}

OpenShift container platform is available as an Azure Resource Manager
solution at https://github.com/Microsoft/openshift-container-platform.

1.  Login to Azure portal and start a new Bash Cloud shell session.

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image5.JPG){width="5.015625546806649in"
    height="2.6565977690288713in"}

2.  From the open terminal, create a new ssh key pair with the name
    "osslab\_rsa" and save it under .ssh directory

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image7.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="1.2520833333333334in"}**\$ ssh-keygen **

1.  Use the Azure CLI v2 to create a new resource group to host the lab
    resources

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image8.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="1.2097222222222221in"}**\$ az group create -n ossdemo -l
> \'West Europe\'**

1.  Create a Key Vault and add your *ssh* private key, created in the
    previous step.

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image9.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="0.6326388888888889in"}**\$ az keyvault create -n ossKV -g
> ossdemo -l \'West Europe\' \--enabled-for-template-deployment true**

> \--vault-name ossKV -n ossSecret \--file \~/.ssh/osslab\_rsa**

The deployment of OpenShift relies on Ansible scripts that should be
configured for Azure as the cloud provider. During and
post-installation, OpenShift requires access to some Azure resources,
like provisioning an Azure managed disk for persistence storage backend.
When you have an application that needs to access or modify resources,
you must set up an Azure Active Directory (AD) application and assign
the required permissions to it. The service principal object defines the
policy and permissions for an application\'s use in a specific tenant,
providing the basis for a security principal to represent the
application at run-time.

1.  Create an Azure Active Directory Service Principal and choose a
    > different password. Copy the resource group scope from step
    > number 3.

> **\$ az ad sp create-for-rbac -n openshiftcloudprovider \--password
> changeMePassword \--role contributor \--scopes
> /subscriptions/f3a5dfdb-e863-40d9-b23c-752b886c0260/resourceGroups/ossdemo**

![](./MediaFolder/media/image11.JPG){width="6.757638888888889in"
height="0.6506944444444445in"}

1.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image12.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}Now, go to the Azure portal and assign the
    required permissions to the service principal "osscloudprovider" on
    the resource group "ossdemo".

![](./MediaFolder/media/image13.JPG){width="5.0in" height="2.65625in"}

![](./MediaFolder/media/image14.JPG){width="5.0in" height="2.65625in"}

1.  Note the application id of your service principal.

> **\$ az ad sp show \--id http://openshiftcloudprovider**

1.  Use the following Azure resource manager solutions
    > [template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-container-platform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
    > to deploy your OpenShift environment:
    > <https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-container-platform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json>

-   At this stage we will need Red Hat Network or Red Hat satellite
    credentials to register RHEL vms with RedHat and get access to the
    required software channels during the deployment. More specifically,
    we will need:

    -   Red Hat Network/Satellite name

    -   The associated password or activation key

-   PoolId provides access to the required software channels for
    Openshift and Cloudforms. PoolId can be listed by invoking the
    command \'subscription-manager list -available\' from a registered
    RHEL system. Contact your Red Hat admin or Red Hat support if you
    are missing information.

-   For high availability consideration, we are deploying 3 vms for each
    type (master, infra and agent). If you want to deploy the lab with
    minimal cost, you can reduce the number of vms to one per each.
    Also, you can scale down the vm families, but preferably stick to
    vms with SSD disks for faster deployment.

-   The master and infra load balancer DNSs (in red circles) should be
    globally unique. Choose your own names.

1.  From the Azure portal, go to your resource group "ossdemo", track
    > the progress of the deployment and make sure the deployment
    > finishes, successfully. The process should last around 20 minutes.
    > It is a good time to have a break.

![](./MediaFolder/media/image21.png){width="5.0in"
height="2.5104166666666665in"}The following diagram explains the
physical architecture of the deployed cluster.

The bastion server implements mainly two distinct functions. One is that
of a secure way to connect to all the nodes, and second that of the
\"installer\" of the system. The bastion host is the only ingress point
for SSH in the cluster from external entities. When connecting to the
OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure, the bastion forwards the
request to the appropriate server.

The next diagram, explains the role and tasks of the Openshift
master/agents and the logical architecture of the solution.

CHALLENGE -2: Create and manage projects 
=========================================

There are many ways to launch images within an OpenShift project. In
this challenge we will focus on the graphical portal.

To create an *application*, you must first create a new *project*, then
select an *InstantApp* template. From there, OpenShift begins the build
process, and creates a new deployment.

1.  Login to your *github* account, or create one if you didn't.

2.  Browse to *openshift/ruby-ex* repository and fork it into your
    > *github* account

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image23.PNG){width="5.0in"
> height="3.370833333333333in"}

1.  From your browser, visit the OpenShift web console at
    > *https://FQDN-master-node:8443*. The web site, uses a self-signed
    > certificate, so if prompted, continue and ignore the browser
    > warning.

2.  Log in using your username and password.

> height="2.65625in"}

1.  To create a new project, click **New Project**.

2.  Type a unique name, display name, and description for the new
    > project.

3.  Click **Create**. The web console's welcome screen should start
    > loading.

CHALLENGE -3: Create and manage Applications
============================================

The *Select Image* or *Template* page gives you the option to add an
application to your project from a publicly accessible *Git* repository,
or from a *template*:

1.  If creating a new project did not automatically redirect you to the
    *Select Image or Template page*, you might need to click **Add to
    Project**.

2.  Click **Browse**, then select

3.  Click the **ruby:latest** builder image.

> ![A screenshot of a social media post Description generated with very
> high confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image28.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="2.65625in"}

1.  Type a **name** for your application, and specify the git repository
    URL you previously forked:
    <https://github.com/%3Cyour_github_username%3E/ruby-ex.git>.

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high
> confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image29.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="2.65625in"}

1.  Optionally, click **Show advanced routing, build, and deployment
    options**. Explore the build configuration and other options and
    note that this example application automatically creates a route,
    *webhook* trigger, and builds change triggers. A *webhook* is an
    HTTP call-back triggered by a specific event.

2.  Click **Create**. Creating your application might take some time.
    note the *payload url,* we will use it later to set a *webhook* in
    your *github* repository.

3.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image30.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}You can follow along on the **Overview** page of
    the web console to see the new resources being created, and watch
    the progress of the build and deployment. Click on "view log", you
    will notice that Openshift is pulling the code of the application
    from Github and building the layers of the container image that will
    host the application. Once the build is complete, Openshift will
    start a new pod.

> ![](./MediaFolder/media/image31.JPG){width="5.0in" height="2.65625in"}
>
> OpenShift leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or
> more containers deployed together on one host. A pod is the smallest
> compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
>
> Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or
> virtual) to a container. Each pod is allocated its own internal IP
> address, therefore owning its entire port space. Containers within
> pods can share their local storage and networking.
>
> While the Ruby *pod* is being created, its status is shown as pending.
> The Ruby *pod* then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP
> address. When the Ruby *pod* is running, the build is complete.
>
> Pods have a lifecycle; they are defined, then they are assigned to run
> on a node, then they run until their container(s) exit or they are
> removed for some other reason. Pods, depending on policy and exit
> code, may be removed after exiting, or may be retained in order to
> enable access to the logs of their containers.

1.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image32.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}From the overview page, click the web address for
    the application in the upper right corner. Verify that the web
    application is up and available.

    ![A screenshot of a social media post Description generated with
    very high confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image33.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

2.  Return to the *OpenShift* admin console. Browse to the project's
    overview page, and test scaling out and in your application by
    increasing or decreasing the number of *pods*, using the up and down
    arrow signs on the web console.

    Scale out the app into 3 pods and watch the progress.

    ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high
    confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image34.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

3.  Browse to **Applications** -**\>** **Pods**, and make sure 3 pods
    serving the same application are now up and running.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description generated with very high

    height="2.65625in"}

CHALLENGE -4: Configuring automated builds
==========================================

Since we forked the source code of the application from the [OpenShift
GitHub repository](https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex), we can use a
*webhook* to automatically trigger a rebuild of the application whenever
code changes are pushed to the forked repository.

To set up a *webhook* for your application:

1.  From the Web Console, navigate to the project containing your
    application.

2.  Click the **Browse** tab, then click **Builds**.

3.  Click your build name, then click the **Configuration** tab.

4.  Click next to **GitHub webhook URL** to copy your *webhook* payload
    URL.

> ![A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high
> confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image36.JPG){width="5.0in"
> height="2.65625in"}

1.  Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click
    **Settings**.

2.  Click **Webhooks & Services** and Click **Add webhook**.

![](./MediaFolder/media/image37.PNG){width="5.0in"
height="2.4145833333333333in"}

1.  Paste your *webhook* URL into the **Payload URL** field.

2.  As Content Type choose application/json

3.  Disable SSL verification and click **Add webhook** to save.

GitHub will now attempt to send a ping payload to your *OpenShift*
server to ensure that communication is successful. If you see a green
check mark appear next to your *webhook* URL, then it is correctly
configured.

Hover your mouse over the check mark to see the status of the last
delivery.

![A screenshot of a social media post Description generated with very
high confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image38.JPG){width="5.0in"
height="2.65625in"}

Next time you push a code change to your forked repository, your
application will automatically rebuild.

CHALLENGE -5: Continuous deployment 
====================================

In this section, we demonstrate one of the most powerful features of
*OpenShift*. We will see how we can trigger a continuous deployment
pipeline, just by committing code change to Github.

Once there is a code change, the Github *webhook* will trigger the build
of a new container image that combines a blueprint image from the
registry with the updated code and generate a new image. This feature is
called ***S2I***, or source to image. Once the build finishes,
*OpenShift* will automatically deploy the new application based on the
new image. This capability enables multiple deployment strategies such
as A/B testing, Rolling upgrades...

1.  Use Azure cloud shell or install *Git* into your local machine

> PS: If you don't want to use *git*, you still can perform this
> challenge by moving to step-5 and editing the file *config.ru*,
> directly from the web interface of *github* and then go to step-7.
>
> Create a "dev" folder and change into.
>
> **\$ mkdir dev && cd dev**

1.  Clone the forked repository to your local system

> **\$ git clone https://github.com/\<YourGithubUsername\>/ruby-ex.git**

1.  Make sure your local *git* repository is referencing to your
    *ruby-ex git*, on *github*:

> **\$ cd ruby-ex**
>
> **\$ git remote -v**

1.  On your local machine, use your preferred text editor to change the
    sample application's source for the file ***config.ru***

> Make a code change that will be visible from within your application.
> For example: on line 229, change the title to "Welcome to your Ruby
> application on OpenShift POWERED BY AZURE!", then save your changes.

1.  Verify the working tree status

> **\$ git status**

1.  Add config.ru content to the index, Commit the change in *git*, and
    push the change to your fork. You will need to authenticate with
    your *github* credentials

> **\$ git add config.ru**
>
> **\$ git commit -m \"simple message\"Â Â **
>
> **\$ git status**
>
> **\$ git push**

1.  If your *webhook* is correctly configured, your application will
    immediately rebuild itself, based on your changes. Monitor the build
    from the graphical console. Once the rebuild is successful, view
    your updated application using the route that was created earlier.
    Now going forward, all you need to do is push code updates and
    OpenShift handles the rest.

1.  You may find it useful to manually rebuild an image if your
    *webhook* is not working, or if a build fails and you do not want to
    change the code before restarting the build. To manually rebuild the
    image based on your latest committed change to your forked
    repository:

    a.  Click the **Browse** tab, then click **Builds**.

    b.  Find your build, then click **Start Build**.

CHALLENGE -6: Mini project: JBOSS EAP application
=================================================

In this mini project, we will deploy a three tiers application
consisting of Leaflet mapping front end with a JaxRS and MongoDB back
end. The application, allows to visualize the locations of major
National Parks and Historic Sites
(https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/restify-mongodb-parks).

During this challenge, we will leverage the CLI tool of OpenShift.

1.  Download and install the OpenShift CLI related to your operating
    system. The easiest way to download the CLI is by accessing the
    About page on the web console if your cluster administrator has
    enabled the download links. Another alternative is to ssh into your
    bastion host that has the CLI tool installed already.

    The reason is that we only deployed the front-end application. What
    we will need now is to add a backend data base. From the web
    console, add a new persistent mongodb data store. And set the needed
    environment variables and specification as bellow:

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image57.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="3.326388888888889in"}

9.  The graphical portal should show two applications in our project

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image58.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

10. From the left menu in the web console, click on storage and verify
    that OpenShift created a persistent storage volume using Azure
    storage.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description generated with very high
    confidence](./MediaFolder/media/image59.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

11. ![](./MediaFolder/media/image60.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="0.9381944444444444in"}Change the deployment configuration of
    the front-end application to include the environment variables
    required to access the database

12. verify the last modification took place by running "oc get dc

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image61.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.9659722222222222in"}nationalparklocator -o json"

13. Back to the graphical console, note the automatic migration to a new
    pod based on the new configuration

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image62.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

14. ![](./MediaFolder/media/image63.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}Navigate to the application end-point and verify
    that the parks are now showing on the map

15. Our new application became very popular, and we need to scale out
    our front end to two pods. Use "oc scale" to do it

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image64.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="1.65625in"}

16. ![](./MediaFolder/media/image65.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.517361111111111in"}Now, let's test the self-healing,
    capabilities of OpenShift by deleting one of the running pods.
    Because, the desired state of the replication controller is 2 pods
    for the application "nationalparklocator", OpenShift will
    automatically and instantly trigger the deployment of a new pod.

CHALLENGE -7: Monitoring oepnshift with azure oms
=================================================

Azure Operations Management Suite (OMS) provides native support to
OpenShift. In this challenge, we will walk through the steps of
configuring OpenShift to export monitoring metrics directly to OMS.

1.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image66.JPG){width="4.8902777777777775in"
    height="6.28125in"}From the Azure portal create a new OMS workspace

2.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image67.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.33125in"}Open the OMS portal and note the workspace id and
    one of the primary keys.

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image68.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.3118055555555554in"}

3.  From Cloud Shell ssh into the bastion host, then ssh into one of the
    master node and create an OpenShift project and user account for
    OMS.

> **\[ossadmin@oss-bastion \~\]\$** ssh oss-master-0
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oadm new-project omslogging
> \--node-selector=\'zone=default\'
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oc project omslogging
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oc create serviceaccount omsagent
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oadm policy
> add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader
> system:serviceaccount:omslogging:omsagent
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oadm policy add-scc-to-user
> privileged system:serviceaccount:omslogging:omsagent

2.  Use wget to download the ocp-\* files from
    <https://github.com/Microsoft/OMS-docker/tree/master/OpenShift>

3.  Make the file "secretgen.sh" executable. Run it, and provide our
    workspace id and key.

> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** chmod +x secretgen.sh
>
> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** ./secretgen.sh

2.  Create an OMS daemon set. A DaemonSet ensures that all the openshift
    cluster nodes run a copy of the oms pod.

> **\[ossadmin@oss-master-0 \~\]\$** oc create -f ocp-secret.yaml

2.  Validate that the daemon set is working properly

2.  Back to OMS portal, you will find that there are new data sources
    exporting metrics.

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image70.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.65625in"}

3.  Create your custom dashboard and start exploring the data exported

CHALLENGE -8: Red Hat Cloud Forms on Azure
==========================================

Red Hat Cloud Forms is an open source cloud management solution
providing a unified and consistent set of management capabilities
across:

-   Virtualization platforms like Red Hat Virtualization, VMware
    vCenter, and Microsoft Hyper-V.

-   Private cloud platforms based on OpenStack.

-   Public cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.

-   Red Hat OpenShift

CloudForms can see and manage both the guest and host systems, allowing
management of workloads and infrastructure within the same system.

CloudForms is a first-class citizen on Azure and provides a solid hybrid
cloud management solution. During this challenge we will walk through
the installation and configuration of CloudFroms on Azure and the
integration with the OpenShift environment created in the previous
steps. In this section we will leverage another powerful open source SDK
to perform the steps: Powershell.

1.  Login to Red Hat network portal and download the latest cloudforms
    vhd image for Azure. You will need an active Red Hat subscription.
    (https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/cloudforms)

2.  We will need to round up the size of the vhd image to a multiple
    number of MB, otherwise the provisioning will fail in the next
    steps. We can use powershell to perform this operation

> **\> Resize-VHD -Path \$LocalImagePath -SizeBytes 32770MB**

1.  ![](./MediaFolder/media/image75.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="2.2729166666666667in"}Login to Azure and Configure some
    variables to use during the deployment. Change \$BlobNameSource and
    \$LocalImagePath to reflect your environment.

2.  Create a new storage account "osscfme" in the "ossdemo" resource
    group to deploy the vhd image to.

    ![](./MediaFolder/media/image76.JPG){width="5.0in"
    height="5.940972222222222in"}

3.  Upload the vhd image into the newly created storage account. This
    operation will take 15 minutes. Time for a break!

**\> Add-AzureRmVhd -ResourceGroupName \$ResourceGroupName -Destination
https://\$StorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/\$BlobSourceContainer/\$BlobNameSource
-LocalFilePath \$LocalImagePath -NumberOfUploaderThreads 8**
